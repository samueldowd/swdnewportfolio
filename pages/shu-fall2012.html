    <p>This course provides a broad overview of the issues managers face in the selection, use, and management of information technology (IT). Increasingly, IT is being used as a tool to implement business strategies and gain competitive advantage, not merely to support business operations. Using a case study approach, topics include information technology and strategy, information technology and organization, and information technology assets management. The course takes a management rather than a technical approach to the material presented. As such, it should be of use to students of general management interested in information technology and to students of information technology interested in management.</p>
