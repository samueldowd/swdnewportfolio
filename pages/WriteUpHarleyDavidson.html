			Provider1 makes the best overall, end-to-end sense as a supplier for Harley-Davidson&rsquo;s SiL&rsquo;K system. There are three main areas in which Provider1 stands out over the other two: Customer service, solutions engineering/customization, and implementation. Below, I will explain to you why Provider1 excels over the other two options in each of those areas.

	</p>
	<p class="c3 c4">

			When selecting a vendor, it is important to evaluate the potential partnership. While functionality seemed to be on the forefront of many of your colleagues&rsquo; minds, it is important to remember that you are not simply picking a software. You are picking a supplier that will lead you through the
		</span>
		<span class="c1">entire</span>
		<span>
			&nbsp;process, from the very first meeting all the way through implementation and ongoing support. Selecting a supplier who you will feel comfortable with, and have trust in, is crucial. The other providers offered more functionality, or more strategic partnerships, but neither offered as much of a commitment to customer service and relationship-building as Provider1.

	<p class="c3 c4">
		<span class="c2">II) Solutions Engineering and Customization</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3 c4">

			It was smart of your team to identify a weakness in Provider1&rsquo;s solution by not having a native web-enablement. However, just because you didn&rsquo;t notice missing pieces of the other providers&rsquo; plans doesn&rsquo;t meant there weren&rsquo;t any. Provider1 was both upfront and proactive about their main weakness. They came prepared with a solution that they were confident in, and they showed a willingness to work out any kinks that come up throughout the process. As a result, you can now have the confidence that they will work with your team to engineer solutions, and customize their product to meet you needs. The other two providers, while more of a fit, and offering more upfront functionality, did not show any potential for solutions engineering and customization like Provider1.

	<p class="c3 c4">
		<span class="c2">III) Implementation</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c3 c4">

			Lastly, and most importantly, it is important for you to consider that this supplier is not just going to create your software for you. They will be responsible for supporting your implementation team, and providing training to ensure a smooth adoption of their product. You need a provider who has a commitment to this part of the process. Provider1 showed a significant commitment to change management and training. These factors are built into their own company&rsquo;s values. They can not only be trusted to build a great product, but also ensure that implementation doesn&rsquo;t stop when the product works. For Provider1, implementation is an ongoing relationship between them and the users to ensure that there is a wide understanding and comprehension of the new product. Provider2 and Provider3 simply did not put as heavy of a focus, or show a history of beginning-to-beyond-end partnership like Provider1.

			Mr. Cotteleer, I thank you for your time and would welcome your feedback. While I think that Provider2 and Provider3 are excellent options, when it comes to what should matter most, Provider1 excels on all counts.
