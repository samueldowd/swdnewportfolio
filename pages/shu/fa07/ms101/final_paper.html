						Question #2:
					</h3>
					<p>
						<span class="pText"> 
							In "Get a Life: Fans, Poachers, Nomads", by Henry Jenkins the term textual poaching appears. This term refers
							to viewers of a certain program taking its text and maneuvering it, and molding
							it to fit their pleasure. These "poachers" take shows such as <i>General
							Hospital</i> or <i>E.R.</i> and analyze them. From their analysis they make
							assumptions based on what they think the outside life of the character should
							be. In other words they bring the characters to life, but on their own terms.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="pText">
							The internet has given way to a whole new means of communication. This new medium
							provides grounds for the viewers to discuss, collaborate, and make assumptions
							as to what will happen next. In some cases their assumptions go beyond the plot
							and take a spin of their own. <i>General Hospital</i>, along with just about
							every other soap opera gathers a following that does just that. If you search
							for a fan site for any soap opera, you will get thousands of hits. It is
							amazing to see the dedication that viewers put into their posts on the message
							boards. The viewers will describe intricate plots beyond the show. If there is
							a scandal on the show itself, posts will pop up almost immediately following
							the action describing the thoughts of the poster. Posters on these websites do
							exactly what Jenkins describes as textual poachers. They take a situation on
							the show and they mold it to fit their fantasy. They then come up with this
							elaborate plot about what will happen next. It's as if they have seen the
							script for the next show. They come up with incredible fantasies, but somehow
							always relate it back, and back their entire story up. This, however, is how
							the soap opera world operates. It is as if the show that is shown on TV is
							simply a prompt for the online world to take it in its own direction. What's
							funny though, is that some of these poachers, get caught up in the poached
							world. There is evidence on these fan websites that fans cannot separate the
							poached world from the real world. There are posts of poached text that gets
							poached further. In other words, someone took another person's poaching, and
							took it their own way, thus poaching the already poached text.

						<span class="pText">
							It is undoubtedly true that textual poaching occurs in these huge television shows. The internet provides the means for this to occur even more so than in the past. <i>Star Trek</i> will always take the cake in terms of textual poaching. Not many shows have their own conventions where attendees dress like the characters and re-enact scenes word for word. However, soap opera fans takepart in their own sort of poaching online. Using message boards, forums, and their own websites they take every word said on the show and make their own story out of it. This may not be as interactive, but it does allow for more creativity.

						<span class="pText">
							Textual	poachers are as much a part of the television media as the shows themselves.
							They just allow for more viewer interaction, which is exactly what the studios
							want, because the more interaction for their show, the more viewers they'll
							get.

						Question #3:
					</h3>
					<p>
						<span class="pText">
							In some of the texts we reviewed this
							semester, many opinions with regard to the value and effect of mass media on
							our culture have been demonstrated. Particularly in Greenwald's <i>Outfoxed</i>,
							Bradbury's <i>Fahrenheit 451, </i>and Jenkins' Ò'Get a Life': Fans, Poachers,
							NomadsÓ are three examples.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="pText">
							In Greenwald's <i>Outfoxed </i>we see a television empire dominated by the
							conservative views of its higher-ups. The film shows us that the effect of a
							biased empire is negative. Using authority figures, most formerly employed by
							FOX, <i>Outfoxed</i> effectively demonstrates its point. It describes how one
							company can control what goes on the air and how that one said company can
							dominate the minds of its viewers, almost brainwashing them.<i> Outfoxed </i>criticizes
							the ability of FOX to control what goes on the air. It criticizes the lack of
							unbiased reporting that our country demands. <i>Outfoxed</i> does not blame the
							viewers, instead it blames the crooked ownership of FOX.<i> Outfoxed</i> does
							not so much offer a solution to the issue, as it does explain it to its
							audience.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="pText">
							In the novel <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> by Ray Bradbury a different sort of control is
							seen over the media. The control comes not from the media itself but by the
							government. The town issues a law that in essence requires books in the town to
							be burned. This is prohibiting the population's ability to choose what
							information they ingest. In turn allowing the town to control what the citizens
							learn. The book focuses in part on the influence of books on our society and
							the information they contain. The book portrays the book burning indirectly as
							a negative solution to the problem. Though it has its own effects in the book,
							such a law would not be effective in our society. The more books burned the
							more our modern society would want to find the information elsewhere, and with
							the internet, this is ever more possible. The control of the government on our
							information has been evident since the FCC came in to play. With censorship
							becoming an ever more popular issue, its publication is more and more evident.
							With issues such as at the Super Bowl with Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake
							becoming front page news not because of the event itself but because of the
							punishment, <i>Fahrenheit 451 </i>becomes increasingly correct in illustrating
							the government's control over our intake of information.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="pText">
							The two texts presented above show a great deal of proof of the media's influence
							over out society, and the various controls that our society has over the media. We cannot choose what comes over the
							air, but we can choose what we watch. If we wanted to see conservative 24/7
							reports on our country we would watch FOX news. If we wanted complete control
							of the government over the books we read we would push for a ban of books in
							our society, thus implementing a book burning plan. Neither of these are
							desirable, but in a society as complex as ours, it is impossible to satisfy the
							desires of everyone, especially when business is involved.
