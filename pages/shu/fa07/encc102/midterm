							Ok girls, it’s go time, today we hit the A&amp;P in our bathing suits and watch that creepy cashier drool as we walk by. Bonus points if that  grouch of a manager compliments our outfits.” I finished up the &nbsp;debriefing just as we pulled into the A&amp;P parking lot. We hopped right out of that light pink T-Bird, well Maddie and I did, Bianca had some issues with the hop as a result of some extra weight she’s been carrying around lately (although not much longer if I have anything to do with it). The pavement was hot on our feet so we did a jumping sort of motion as if we were in a video game where you jump from stone to stone to avoid the lava. As the leader of the trio I took the lead as we strutted into A&amp;P. There he was, tall kind of dorky, and lanky stood Sammy the cashier. “Target located girls, let’s move.”

							We moved into his sight around the time we passed the bread section. He didn’t quite notice us yet, he was  were glued to the register, hoping to catch Sammy in a mistake. What a sad life that is. It’s as if she goes shopping in order to simply catch the cashier trying to screw you out of a few cents. He disappeared from our view just as he got caught ringing up a box of HiHo crackers twice. How I would have loved to stick around to see that one, but we had a cover to maintain.
						</span>

						<span class="pText">
							We did a quick circle of the bread section and returned to within viewing range of Sammy. At this point he noticed us, and he wasn’t fooling anyone. His eyes did the up-and-down thing guys think girls can’t see. His eyes flowed from head to toe like one of those fingerprint scanners you see in a spy movie. &nbsp;He started with Bianca. Now, I’ll be honest, Bianca was not an attractive young lady. She had a bright green two-piece on, and it didn’t go well with the pale white stomach that folded over the bottoms. When his eyes reached her bare feet, they moved over to Maddie’s. Maddie was slightly above Bianca on the pretty scale. She’s one of those girls who you hope guys compare you to: “Well she’s nice, but look at <em>her</em>.” Don’t get me wrong she is striking and attractive, but no guy seems to want her. His eyes reached her head, and rolled over to mine, which was slightly lower than the other two. I could feel the girls in back of me peering over my shoulder. Amateurs. As the leader of the trio I was still out front trying my best to get the followers to follow properly. The walk was tough, as I didn’t do much walking in bare feet, but I managed, and we carried on.

							Before going in the store, I casually let my straps fall off my shoulders. I could tell Sammy stopped there, at my midsection, for a few split-seconds, mesmerized by the amount of skin showing. He seemed to have gotten distracted by my chest, as his eyes moved back up to examine my hair. Though time in the sun had lightened it, it was still its oaky self. Without staring directly at him for the sake of awkwardness, I did notice out of the corner of my eye another cashier at slot 2 staring at us. A turn came up on us pretty quick and we veered down the aisle, maintaining our V-formation. It seemed everyone was walking against us and admiring &nbsp;our outfits in a rather unadmiring way. We disturbed some of the women who you could tell were the regulars. You know the ones, those with six children, and the varicose veins. But what did we care, we were on a mission.
						</span>
					</p>

							We approached the meat counter, a lot of confusing pointing occurred between us and the meat guy and we left shortly after we arrived. We were out of range of Sammy or that other creepy cashier. I could feel the meat guy’s eyes on our backs as we strutted away. We picked up what we needed real quick from the meat aisle, and proceeded back up to the front to check out. It was quite the dilemma for us checking out. We walked up to the front end and saw two registers open: Sammy and the creepy guy. Luckily our decision was made for us as an elder gentleman hobbled up to slot 2 with his four cans of pineapple juice. So, left without a choice we went into slot three and approached Sammy. You could never imagine just a 49 cent can of sour cream could be so awkward to buy. Then again, awkward seemed to be Sammy’s middle name. He appeared nervous as a convict awaiting sentencing. &nbsp;I noticed him noticing my hand and the lack of jewelry. Little did he know, I could have just been swimming and taken it all off. So, just to add a little kick to the experience, I paid with a dollar that I took out of my cleavage. I could feel the grin of the girls behind me. I hope they learn from this.

							Remember the bonus challenge? Here it comes. The manager, who was clearly agitated, walked in from outside. He walked towards the MANAGER door, but he saw us and spun on his heels and came for us. He had the brass to tell us, “Girls, this isn’t the beach.” I’m now a little embarrassed and I start to blush, I can’t help it, I’m just trying to have some fun. I explain to him, “My mother asked me to pick up a jar of Herring snacks.” Out of the corner of my eye I caught Sammy’s surprised face when I spoke. I was more focused on that than what the Manager had to say. It sounded as if he repeated himself, but I came to when I realized he was glaring at me. Right into my eyes his eyes stared. It was scary, I’ll be honest.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="pText">
							“We weren’t doing any shopping. We just came in for one thing.” Bianca popped up from behind me. I chuckled as I saw Sammy notice Bianca up close for the first time.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="pText">
							“That makes no difference, we want you decently dressed when you come in here” said the manager. I thought it was funny when I saw him look back at Bianca. I don’t think he had realized how inappropriately dressed she was.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="pText">
							“We are decent,” I refuted.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="pText">
							“Girls, I don’t want to argue. After this come in here with your shoulders covered. It’s our policy.” The manager said before turning around and starting his walk to the MANAGER door.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="pText">
							I turned around real quick to observe the state of the store, and noticed that those varicose vein mothers had started to pile up like sheep. It was like a curiosity delay on the highway during rush-hour. Some had gone into slot two, where the creepy cashier was getting nervous. The manager turned again from his walk to the door.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="pText">
							“Sammy, have you rung up this purchase?” he asked.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="pText">
							I could tell Sammy was getting aggravated. I mean, he was being insulted, and crapped on by his boss in front of some nice eye candy. He started to type at the register as if it were a song. He seemed to have a rhythm to it. It was fun watching him unfold the dollar bill that had been in my cleavage, it was quite obvious that he was savoring the touching of the bill, as he was staring directly at my breasts the whole time. Finally the bill was unfolded, and the eyes lifted from my chest to my face. He was then able to put the herring snacks into a bag, twisted it, and give it to me.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="pText">
							What happened next would earn us some great bonus points. I heard the two words I had always wanted to cause a man to say, “I quit,” said Sammy. The girls behind me flinch as if they want to stop, but I make a discreet gesture to continue our exit. We left quickly so as not to attract any more attention. Once we had cleared the A&amp;P I looked back through the windows and saw Sammy taking his apron and bowtie off. I never knew that bowtie was actually A&amp;P’s. I begin to walk faster, as do the girls behind me, as we don’t want Sammy to catch up to us. The annoyance of a mother attempting to put her children in her blue Falcon station-wagon was almost worse than watching Sammy watch my chest as if it were a baseball game.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="pText">
							In summary of our trip to A&amp;P, we got Sammy to quit his job, the creepy guy at slot two probably drooled a few times, and the manager “complimented” our outfits. I’m not sure if compliment is the right word if you are a conservative dresser. For those of us, however, who enjoy straps down to our elbows, and tan lines exposed, we take it as a compliment. I enjoyed adding some sass to Queenie’s rebuttal at Lengel’s suggestion that their clothes were not decent. Queenie, as I was reading Updike’s version I saw as a sassy girl, ready to snap at anything.

							I turned around real quick to observe the state of the store, and noticed that those varicose vein mothers had started to pile up like sheep.

							The preceding story is a rewrite of A&amp;P by John Updike from the point of view of the leader of the group of girls that the main character looks at and admires while working. In rewriting this short story I chose the leader, who Sammy calls “Queenie” to be my narrator because Updike gave her a lot of character and spunk in the story that her personality was easy to create. I chose to create a story for the girls, explaining their motivation while in the store. It was hard for me to believe that three girls would walk into a supermarket dressed as they are, without any motivation. That is why I gave them a type of informal point system. This point system allowed them to set goals for what they wanted to do in A&amp;P. Sammy in the original story seems to get a subtle pleasure out of Lengel’s anger, so I figured it would be nice to play on that by adding bonus points for upsetting him. I felt it necessary for the characters to be on an interactive level with each other. Updike did not touch on this so much, but I elaborated it almost making it seem like a sorority pledging with a leader, and two followers who literally followed the leader and her every move. Updike portrayed “Queenie” as a somewhat stuck up individual, and I wanted to make sure I added that touch to the rewritten narration.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="pText">
							Updike uses a humorous tone and many similes and metaphors. I tried to recreate the humorous tone, and put a few humorous similes and metaphors in to replicate those of Updike. Queenie and her followers are an interesting bunch. They are going through a supermarket barefoot and in somewhat inappropriate clothing. This is a humorous touch that Updike added which I picked up on and elaborated. In Queenie’s description of her followers she is rather conservative and nicer than Updike was. I stuck to the story pretty closely throughout the rewritten narration. This was an option that was difficult to choose, as Updike allowed for so much room for interpretation. The dialog was not changed much at all, as I felt it important to the essence of the story that Lengel’s tone be conveyed as it was originally.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="pText">
							I particularly enjoyed the description Updike gave of the shopping moms with six kids and varicose veins. I used this in the rewrite as it conveyed a good image, and also a good stereotype of the classic family grocery shopper. Confrontation between the girls and the shoppers was avoided in the rewrite, as Queenie was oblivious to it. In the part where they are heading down the aisle against traffic Updike makes it clear that shoppers are agitated by the girls’ pushing through the aisle. The girls, too self-absorbed thought nothing of it and therefore it was not worth the mention.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="pText">
							Overall, the three girls were able to pull off their goal of frustrating A&amp;P. They got the bonus points, and got extra bonus for causing Sammy to quit. I thought it was interesting in the story that Sammy quit his job to try to get the girls, but he missed them. I chose to omit that, as the girls were oblivious to Sammy’s full plan. The rewritten story incorporates all of the elements of the original which pertain to Queenie. Queenie seems to outwit Sammy and Stokesie and Lengel, which is interesting as she is quite powerless in the situation she is in as a customer. The story of the girls at A&amp;P and Sammy is an interesting one when told by Sammy, it becomes even more compelling when you tell it from Queenie’s point of view.
