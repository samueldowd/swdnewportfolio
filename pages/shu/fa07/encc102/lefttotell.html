    Personal Narrative Analyzed</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class=
    "c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the book</span>
    <span class="c1">Left to Tell</span><span class="c3">, by Immaculee
    Ilibagiza, the reader reads a story of a woman who endured ultimate
    hardships during the Rwandan Genocide. As a result of her struggles she has
    gone on to write this book, and speak at many different places about her
    story. The text is presented as a personal narrative, a story about her
    time during those terrible days. Immaculee creates an identity for herself
    in the tone of her narrative, her style evokes a sympathetic feeling from
    the reader, and her she uses time setting well in order to benefit the
    telling of the story. Though she presents many facts, it is often hard for
    the reader to believe what she is saying as a result of the atrocity of the
    facts.</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class=
    "c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone of the
    narrative</span> <span class="c1">Left to Tell</span><span class=
    "c3">&nbsp;is upbeat and captivating. The narrative opens, “I was born in
    paradise.” (Ilibagiza, 3) The reader gets an idea from the cover of the
    book and the full title, that this is not a true statement. It is, however,
    an example of Ilibagiza’s upbeat tone throughout the narrative. Paradise
    invokes a wonderful image in the readers mind. If we were to think of it
    relative to our situation here in America though, we would not find this to
    be true. She was born into a wealthy family, in comparison to the rest of
    her village. However, that still involved an eight-mile walk to school, and
    a house that would be considered, “extremely modest by Western standards.”
    (5) In spite of this, she still talks of it as though it were a mansion.
    During her introduction of herself to the reader, Ilibagiza develops an
    immediate relationship with the reader. She uses simple language, unlike
    other literary classics, to further develop that relationship throughout
    the book. Ilibagiza captivates her audience with every new scene. She uses
    vocabulary to simply state what she wants to convey. At one point she
    speaks of a man who was, “hacked to death just a few hundred yards down the
    road.” (66) This type of wording is common throughout the book. Ilibagiza
    does not side-step the issues. She comes out and bluntly states what she
    means to say. This aspect of the story ameliorates it greatly. It truly
    catches the reader’s attention. Generally, as a society, we are captivated
    by violence. In films, novels, and this narrative this is proven. In this
    narrative the language used to describe the events is simple, and therefore
    allows the reader to not have to think about what they are reading, but
    instead read with ease. It is Ilibagiza’s intention to have this effect. If
    she had elaborated and used fancy wording with each description, it would
    be impossible to keep the reader’s interest. The subject matter is
    captivating enough, there is no need to change it around to make it sound
    better, in order to try to capture the reader more. Ilibagiza’s use of a
    simplistic vocabulary, a seemingly positive tone, and a constant feeling of
    action, truly bring her story to life, and help to tell it better. She uses
    her first person voice to provide reliability, and trust. It is that
    reliability and trust that allows us to believe what she is saying, even
    when it may seem untrue. Many aspects of this narrative develop legitimacy
    between Ilibagiza and the reader which is key in a narrative of this
    type.</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class=
    "c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The style of</span>
    <span class="c1">Left to Tell</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;leads us to a
    sympathetic feeling as we are reading. Ilibagiza uses linguistic tactics
    that allow the reader to get deeply involved in the story. It seems at
    times as if Ilibagiza would like the reader to sympathize with her. She
    says later in the book, “Sorrow welled up in me, and I had to step away
    from the others,” (148) Her sad tone seems to beg the reader to feel for
    her, and have sympathy for her. It is apparent that Ilibagiza wants people
    to learn about what happened, but at the same time her voice throughout the
    narrative makes the reader very sympathetic. The picture of the front cover
    of the book shows a sad Immaculee Ilibagiza. This is quite contrary to the
    end of the book. Ilibagiza ends the book as a happy, jovial person wanting
    to embrace life, and live each day to the fullest. This is not what the
    cover shows. The cover shows a woman with a face that appears to wonder.
    There are dark skies behind her and leads to a negative feeling about the
    cover. It makes the reader believe the tone of the book will be sad. While
    it is sad, Ilibagiza talks about her forgiveness for the horrible things
    that happened. She speaks of how she has moved past the violence and looks
    toward a future solution to the problem. A reader would not be able to
    guess this by looking at the cover, instead they would see a woman with
    deep issues and sympathize with her. They would expect to read a book
    filled with sadness, and offering no sense of positivity. If this was the
    case, it would not have risen to the top of the New York Times Bestsellers
    List. Life for Ilibagiza is agreeably hard. However, she uses her
    experiences to draw out emotion from her reader. As a result of trying so
    hard to get emotion of out her readers, Ilibagiza is believed to have
    exaggerated her story slightly. She explains, “within a few hours
    approximately 2,000 men, women, and children were camped out in front of
    our house.” (48) This is hard for the reader to believe, as two-thousand
    people is a lot of people. It is not probable that that many people would
    fit on the front lawn of Ilibagiza. That is, not to mention that this is a
    gathering of Hutus, and the Tutsis are looking for them at this point. It
    begs the question: Wouldn’t they come running with machetes, guns, and
    hundreds of men to kill these two-thousand Hutus. It makes the reader think
    about Ilibagiza’s legitimacy. Though she tries hard to create this
    legitimacy, it takes a hit when she says this kind of statement. No doubt
    she suffered through a horrible ordeal. Nonetheless she need not exaggerate
    aspects of it in order to make the reader feel bad for her. Ilibagiza’s use
    of situations like this to evoke sympathy from the reader is unnecessary,
    but effective. They do work if they are believed. Granted there are many
    irrefutable facts presented in this novel, it is safe to say that some of
    the stories are embellished by Ilibagiza to emphasize her story or a part
    of her story. While this is not an accepted practice, it does serve its
    purpose. Many of the readers finish the book and think about what Ilibagiza
    went through, and they grieve for her and her losses. It is seemingly clear
    from the last few chapters that Ilibagiza does not want this, but at the
    same time she contradicts herself by using words and stories to bring out
    those emotions in her many readers.</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class=
    "c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time, and setting also
    play a large role in Ilibagiza’s narrative. Ilibagiza uses the events of
    the Rwandan Holocaust to tell her story. She does a splendid job at the
    beginning of the narrative explaining her surrounding town, and her life
    before the holocaust. In fact she spends a significant portion of the
    beginning of the book talking about life before the holocaust. Her setting
    is a calm one before the holocaust, but she changes that setting
    explicitly, when the genocide starts. When the genocide starts she clearly
    states to the reader that things had changed. Life was going to become more
    difficult, and more dangerous. Ilibagiza conveyed this well to her readers
    over the span of multiple paragraphs. In doing so she explains how time has
    changed. The genocide lasted about one-hundred days. She tries to condense
    before the genocide, during the genocide, and her life after the genocide
    into just 210 pages. It is safe say that she left events out of her written
    story for the sake of saving pages, and maintaining the interest of her
    reader. Ilibagiza tells the reader that she enjoyed writing the book. She
    explains her motivation for writing the book as a way to help others to
    forgive just as she did. Ilibagiza’s use of time and setting to further the
    telling of her story really served its purpose, and allows the reader to
    truly visualize what is happening in the narrative.</span></p>

    <p class="c2"><span class=
    "c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately,
    Ilibagiza’s story has touched many lives. It is a result of the
    first-person style that she uses that this is achieved. If Ilibagiza had
    used third-person, it would have created a disconnected story. The reader
    would not have been able to get as into the story as they were able to with
    first-person. It was the goal of Ilibagiza to achieve this connection. The
    book conveys a wonderful message of forgiveness, while also educating the
    world about the atrocity of the Rwandan Genocide. Ilibagiza does an
    excellent job of portraying it as a crisis using her language, and time and
    setting. Immaculee Ilibagiza has written a narrative of her experience,
    which while invoking sympathy, allows us to empathize with her and share in
    her goal to achieve peace in the world. Ilibagiza’s book started out with,
    “I was born in paradise.” (3) It is only fitting that she end the book with
    a statement of her theme: “Forgiveness is all I have to offer.”</span></p>
